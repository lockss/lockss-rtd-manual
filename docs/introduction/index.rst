The LOCKSS system is a distributed digital preservation software system developed by the `LOCKSS Program <https://www.lockss.org/>`_ at `Stanford University Libraries <https://library.stanford.edu/>`_.

The 2.x series of the LOCKSS system stems from the LAAWS (LOCKSS Architected As Web Services) initiative, an ambitious modernization project that includes rewriting the classic LOCKSS daemon as a suite of containerized components. This version, LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3, is the third preview release on the road to LOCKSS 2.0.

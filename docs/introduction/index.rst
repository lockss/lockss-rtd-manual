Introduction
============

The LOCKSS system is a distributed digital preservation software system developed by the `LOCKSS Program <https://www.lockss.org/>`_, a division of the `Digital Library Systems and Services <https://library.stanford.edu/department/digital-library-systems-and-services-dlss>`_ department at `Stanford University Libraries <https://library.stanford.edu/>`_.

The 2.x series of the LOCKSS system stems from the LAAWS (LOCKSS Architected As Web Services) initiative, an ambitious modernization project that includes rewriting the classic LOCKSS daemon as a suite of containerized components, funded in part by a grant from the `Andrew W. Mellon Foundation <https://mellon.org/>`_.

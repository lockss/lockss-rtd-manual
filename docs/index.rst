It is not yet possible to convert from a classic LOCKSS system (e.g. version 1.74.10) to a LOCKSS 2.0 system. To help us advance toward the final LOCKSS 2.0 release, please consider installing and running the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3 release on a test machine and :ref:`providing us with your feedback <Contact Us>`_.

   I have a LOCKSS system running 2.0-alpha2. Can I upgrade to LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3?

   .. rubric:: Footnotes

   .. [#fn1] The system's containers are generated by Docker in development, which produces containers that run on ``containerd`` at runtime. In previous releases, they were also orchestrated by Docker Swarm at runtime, so Docker was required on host machines. Starting with this release, the containers are orchestrated by Kubernetes at runtime instead, so Docker is not required on host machines.

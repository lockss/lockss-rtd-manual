=========================
Migrating From LOCKSS 1.x
=========================

An upcoming version of the classic LOCKSS system will contain an experimental tool to copy select archival units (AUs) from a production LOCKSS 1.x system to a test LOCKSS 2.x system, for testing purposes. When this tool is released, this page will be updated with instructions for how to perform a test copy. Test migrations and eventual real migrations will be available at a later time.

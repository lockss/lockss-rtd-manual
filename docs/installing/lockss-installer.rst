Downloading the LOCKSS Installer
================================

You can download the LOCKSS Installer from GitHub using a `Git <git>`_ command, as the ``lockss`` user:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/lockss/lockss-installer

All the remaining instructions assume that the current working directory is ``lockss-installer``; ``cd`` to it now:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd lockss-installer

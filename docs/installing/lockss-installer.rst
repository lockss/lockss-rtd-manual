Downloading the LOCKSS Installer
================================

To download the LOCKSS Installer from `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_, run this `Git <git>`_ command as the ``lockss`` user [#fnlockss]_ :

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/lockss/lockss-installer

Unless otherwise noted, all remaining instructions assume that the current working directory is the :file:`lockss-installer` directory created by the :program:`git clone` command; change to this directory now:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd lockss-installer

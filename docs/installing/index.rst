============================
Installing the LOCKSS System
============================

.. note::

   **This chapter describes how to install the LOCKSS 2.0-beta1 system.**

   *  **If you are upgrading an existing LOCKSS 2.0-alpha4 system to LOCKSS 2.0-beta1**, go to :doc:`/upgrading/index` instead.

   *  **If you are migrating an existing LOCKSS 1.x system to LOCKSS 2.0-beta1**, go to :doc:`/appendix/migrating` first if you have not already.

.. tip::

   Before you begin installing the LOCKSS system, we strongly recommend you first bring your operating system up to date by applying security updates and upgrading installed packages. Ask your system administrator or see :doc:`/appendix/os-updates` in the appendix.

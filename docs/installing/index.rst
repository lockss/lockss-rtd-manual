============================
Installing the LOCKSS System
============================

This chapter describes how to install LOCKSS 2.0-alpha4 for the first time.

*  **If you are upgrading from LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3**, see :doc:`/upgrading/index`.

*  **If you are currently running the LOCKSS 1.x system**, for example version 1.75.7 of the `LOCKSS daemon <https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon>`_, you can use the instructions in this chapter to test the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha4 system on another machine, but it is not yet possible to migrate your classic system.

*  **Before you begin installing the LOCKSS 2.x system**, we strongly recommend you first bring your operating system up to date by applying security updates and upgrading installed packages.

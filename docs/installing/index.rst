============================
Installing the LOCKSS System
============================

.. tip::

   If you are upgrading from LOCKSS 2.0-alpha3, see :doc:`/upgrading/index`.

.. note::

  If you are currently running the LOCKSS 1.x system, for example version 1.75.7 of the `LOCKSS daemon <https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon>`_, you can use the instructions in this section to test the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha4 system on another machine, but it is not yet possible to migrate your classic system.

This chapter describes how to install the LOCKSS 2.x system for the first time.

============================
Installing the LOCKSS System
============================

This section describes how to install the LOCKSS 2.x system for the first time.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of the LOCKSS 2.x system, for example 2.0-alpha3, see :doc:`/introduction/upgrading`.

If you are currently running the LOCKSS 1.x system, for example version 1.75.5 of the `LOCKSS daemon <https://github.com/lockss/lockss-daemon>`_, you can use the instructions in this section to test the LOCKSS 2.0-alpha4 system on another machine, but it is not yet time to migrate your classic system.
